# Cybernetics Core Milestones

This project is designed to explore and make available and useful information and code on videogames and AI. For more background see the other general proposal. A set of specific goals is outlined below. The end goal of this project is to create a highly competitive StarCraft 2 bot.

For this first semester there is a large amount of background knowledge to be acquired. 

1.	Simple games/objectives will be demonstrated using AI and the documentation on this will not only help inform the project as it continues but also others learning AI and video games (likely in python)
  2.	While working in Python making simple games and AIs, C++ skills will be acquired.
* 3.	The SC2 API will be set up to be usable and further documentation will be made to expand upon what Blizzard has already provided
* 4.	It will be demonstrated that the API works and that a game can be created and launched vs humans and other bots
* 5.	A simple bot will be made, with a pre-programmed (‘quasi hard coded’) strategy. E.g. worker rush, cannon rush, mass mutalisk, etc.
* 6.	(Potentially) A simple bot will be made utilizing techniques learned from the earlier exploratory phase
* 7.	For future semesters, this bot can constantly be improved upon and more AI techniques and training can be involved

These are not necessarily in the exact order that they will happen, not can it be guaranteed that they will happen. However, over the course of the semester, updated information will be posted.
